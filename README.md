Predict Credit Consumption of Customer for a Bank

Project Overview

This project aims to predict the credit consumption of customers for a leading bank using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to forecast customers' spending habits based on data from the past three months, facilitating better strategic planning and enhancing customer experience.

Steps Involved:

1. Introduction to the Problem ❓
The challenge involves predicting the credit card consumption for the upcoming months based on various factors such as customer demographics, liabilities, assets, and past spending patterns.

2. Identification of Machine Learning Type 🔎
We will use Supervised Learning for this regression-based problem, where the model learns from labeled datasets to predict future credit consumption.

3. Data Collection and Info 🛠
The data encompasses details of customer demographics, liabilities, transaction history, and credit card spending across three months (April, May, June) along with projections for the next three months (July, August, September).

4. Exploratory Data Analysis 📊
Visualize and analyze the data to identify patterns, trends, and correlations using various statistical methods and graphs.

5. Data Preprocessing 🧬
Clean the data, handle missing values, normalize numerical values, and encode categorical variables.

6. Train-Test Split 🌓
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

7. Model Building 🏗
Various regression models are applied to predict credit consumption, including algorithms like Random Forest, Linear Regression, and others.

8. Metrics Evaluation 📝
Evaluation of the models is based on metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R² to determine the best-performing model.

9. Model Selection ✔
Based on the evaluation, the model with the lowest error is selected for final predictions.

11. Prediction 🎯
The final model predicts future credit consumption for the next three months.

Business Problem:
The credit card industry is rich in data, offering a wealth of insights into customer behavior and spending patterns. By analyzing this data, banks can craft targeted marketing campaigns, refine their credit strategies, and predict customer needs. This project supports the bank's objective to leverage data-driven decision-making to manage and enhance credit consumption effectively.
